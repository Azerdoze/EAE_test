"dialog-box-button is a simple component that works as a button that toggles the view of a slot inside of it: so in order for it to work it needs to be:"

"<dialog-box-button>
    <slot>content to be toggled</slot>
</dialog-box-button>"

"dialog-box is a follow-up of the previous component, where it makes a simple chat window where users can input a title and a text-area (kept inside a form)."
"the box has two buttons (which is a repurpose of the previous component): cancel and confirm."

"cancel should close the window and reset the form input fields"

"confirm submits the input values"

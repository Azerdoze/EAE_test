"Eurico Lit Components" 

"NOTE: I noticed there has been a whole bunch of downloads. PLEASE be advised this is a prototype and by no means should be optimal (I am still trying to see how to use npm correctly). As soon as I understand fully how to do it right I'll update this readme."

"The package consists of two custom components made via Lit (2.0) that should be usable in any framework"

"dialog-box-button is a simple component that works as a button that toggles specifically the view of dialog-box".

"dialog-box is a follow-up of the previous component, where it makes a simple chat window where users can input a title and a text-area (kept inside a form)."
"the box has two buttons (which is a repurpose of the previous component): cancel and confirm."

"cancel should close the window and reset the form input fields"

"confirm submits the input values"

"the html should be like this (with <> instead of the --):
"- dialog-box-button /-"
"- dialog-box /-"
